## 🔄 What Happens After 4 Years?

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

### "Can I charge for my tools?"
**Yes!** Build and sell as many tools as you want. There are no restrictions on monetizing YOUR tools.

### "Can I see the source code?"
**Yes!** All documentation and examples are available on GitHub. We're source-available, meaning you can read everything.

### "Can I fork and modify?"
**Yes!** You can fork, modify, and share your changes. Just don't offer it as a competing platform.

### "Can I use this at my company?"
**Yes!** Internal business use is completely unrestricted.

### "What if I accidentally violate the license?"
**Contact us immediately!** We're reasonable and can work out a solution (often a commercial license). Email: dev@kinnovations.ch

### "Can I contribute improvements back?"
**Yes please!** We welcome all contributions - bug fixes, documentation improvements, tool examples.

### "What exactly is 'competing'?"
**Competing means**:
- Offering Vectoryon itself as a product/service
- Building a similar AI automation platform using our code
- Creating a hosted version of Vectoryon for customers

**NOT competing**:
- Building tools that run ON Vectoryon
- Creating complementary services
- Using similar architecture patterns you learned here

### "Why not just use MIT or Apache?"
**Good question!** We want to:
1. Enable a free developer ecosystem (✅ you can build tools)
2. Protect our business from direct competitors (❌ no copying the platform)
3. Guarantee eventual full open source (🔄 Apache 2.0 in 2029)

BSL gives us all three. MIT/Apache would allow competitors to copy everything immediately.

### "What happens if Kinnovations shuts down?"
The license still converts to Apache 2.0 on December 2, 2029, regardless of Kinnovations' status. Your rights are guaranteed.

### "Can I use this in my portfolio?"
**Yes!** Show off the tools you built on Vectoryon in your portfolio.
